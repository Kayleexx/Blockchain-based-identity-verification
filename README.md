# Blockchain-Based Identity Verification System

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for a blockchain-based identity verification system implemented in Solidity, a programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The system aims to provide decentralized identity management, enabling users to control and verify their identity information securely without relying on centralized authorities.

## Features
- **Decentralized Identity Framework**: Utilizes blockchain technology to establish a secure and immutable ledger of identity records.
- **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)**: Empowers users with complete control and ownership over their identity information.
- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**: Unique identifiers for users to ensure secure and privacy-preserving identity verification.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**: Allows users to validate identity attributes without compromising sensitive information.
- **Smart Contracts for Access Control**: Enforces user-centric access control mechanisms using smart contracts.
- **Integration with Social Identity**: Explore integration of social media identities for enhanced validation and reputation management.
- **Incentivized Node Participation**: Token-based incentive mechanisms to encourage active node participation in the verification process.
- **Experimental Validation**: Thorough experimental validation to assess functionality, security, and performance parameters.
